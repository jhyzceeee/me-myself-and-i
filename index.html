        <p>I am Jhyzcee Ron Noel R. Manalastas, 18 years of age and I live in SJDM, Bulacan. I'm currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Colegio de San Gabriel Arcangel. My parents are Jayson S. Manalastas and Christine Lvi B. Rivera. My hobbies are watching movies, specially sci-fi and mystery/thriller movies, playing online games and I also play basketball. My childhood dream was to become a pilot but it's expensive that's why I end up being an IT student. My dream is to become a successful programmer and have a peaceful and happy family. I also want to live near the seashore where it is quiet. I would also like to travel to different places and country once I become financially stable.</p>
